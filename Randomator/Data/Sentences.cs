            "By getting the security response teamp involved at this stage, it will ensure the organization is ready.",
            "If you're feeling the stress of continued change and uncertainty, you aren't alone.",
            "Change can be overwhelming, we have five tips you can do right now to navigate new situations as they arise.",
            "Thanks to everyone who joined our program, your participation is greatly appreciated.",
            "We will be able to complete the project as soon as we can travel again.",
            "Please send me the report so that I can complete the project.",

            "Our new, updated version of the project is finally up and running!",
            "You can order directly from our store.",
            "You may have heard about such solutions before, but we assure you our product is one of a kind.",
            "Following these guidelines is important since it shows that you are taking the correspondence seriously",
            "In business transactions he was frugal with his money, but when it came to his family, he was generous.",
            "He remembered how carefully and at what length everything relating to form and procedure was discussed at those meetings, and how sedulously and promptly all that related to the gist of the business was evaded.",
            "She included among her enemies the creditors and all who had business dealings with her father, and always at the thought of enemies and those who hated her she remembered Anatole who had done her so much harm--and though he did not hate her she gladly prayed for him as for an enemy.",
            "The medical profession is justly conservative. Human life should not be considered as the proper material for wild experiments.",
            "Conservatism, however, is too often a welcome excuse for lazy minds, loath to adapt themselves to fast changing conditions.",
            "Those who really desire to attain an independence, have only to set their minds upon it, and adopt the proper means, as they do in regard to any other object which they wish to accomplish, and the thing is easily done",
            "The very name is an anomaly. From a literary point of view there is no such thing. English is English whether it be used to express the creations of our imagination, our aesthetic appreciations, or our daily wants. There is no magical combination of words, phrases, and sentences that is peculiar and distinctive to business transactions. Business English as used in these pages means effective communication, both oral and written. The author's aim throughout has been to teach the art of using words in such a way as to make people think and act. To do this she has applied the principles of literary composition to the highly complex and ever increasing problems of our business life. She realizes that business is vital, and that the problems of commerce are not to be met and handled with dead forms and stereotyped expressions of legal blanks.",
            "But in taking this point of view, we should not minimize the importance of written business English.",
            "In a way, it is more difficult to write well than it is to talk well.",
            "In talking we are not troubled with the problems of correct spelling, proper punctuation, and good paragraphing.",
            "We may even repeat somewhat, if only we are persuasive. But in writing we are confronted with the necessity of putting the best thoughts into the clearest, most concise language, at the same time obeying all the rules of spelling, punctuation, and grammar. The business man must be sure of these details in order to know that his letters and advertising matter are correct. The stenographer, especially, must be thoroughly familiar with them, so that she may correctly transcribe what has been dictated.",
            "Practically all of this information a good dictionary gives.",
            "In other words, a dictionary is a story book containing not one, but hundreds of thousands of stories.",
            "Whenever possible it tells what language a word came from, how it got its different meanings, and how those meanings have changed in the course of time.",
            "For it is natural that words should change just as styles change, names of ancient things being lost and names for new things being made.",
            "As the objects themselves have gone out of use, their names have also gone. When a word has gone entirely out of use, it is marked obsolete in the dictionary.",
            "On the other hand, new inventions must be named. Thus new words are constantly being added to the language and the dictionary because they are needed.",
            "Sometimes, again, you will find that the subject you have chosen is not good because it is not definite enough.",
            "You hardly know where or how to begin to explain it, because it suggests no definite ideas.",
            "Perhaps, for instance, you have decided to write on the automobile and can think of nothing to say until you remember that you once saw an automobile race about which you can tell several interesting details; or you have seen an automobile accident and can write on the topic A Runaway Electric.", 
            "If you can speak or write on a topic taken from your own observation, your composition will probably be good. You know the facts, you have an interest in the subject, and you will very likely say something of interest to others.", 
            "Subjects taken from school life or neighborhood happenings, especially such things as you yourself have seen, are excellent.",
            "Perhaps on your way to school you noticed that several old houses are being torn down.", 
            "You remember that you heard that a candy factory is to be erected.", 
            "At once several suggestions for themes will come to you; as, Why the Factory is Being Erected in this Neighborhood, How Neighborhoods Change in a Large City, The Work the Wrecking Company Carries on.", 
            "Perhaps your father owns property in the neighborhood, and you could write on How Real Estate Values have Changed in this Neighborhood.",
            "After you have selected your subject, decide into what divisions it naturally falls. If it is of the proper length, it probably will divide itself into two or three divisions. Each of these will constitute one-half or one-third of your composition, and within each division illustrations, reasons, and explanatory details will appear. Arrange the divisions in the order in which they naturally come, according to their relative time of happening or according to their relative importance, reserving the most important for the last.",
            "Sometimes this sort of division is difficult to make, because a subject can frequently be treated from different points of view, the point of view deciding the divisions.",
            "In that case, you probably do not know enough about it. Think about it again, and, if you find that you really cannot divide it, choose another.",
            "If your theme consists of more than one division, before you begin to speak or write you should prepare a definite working plan or outline.",
            "It should include enough to suggest the first sentence of each division and the more important details within each.",
            "The outline will help you in speaking or writing to arrange the topics so that they will follow one another clearly.",
            "If you have an outline, there will be much less danger of including details which do not belong to the subject and of omitting details which should appear.",
            "Farming is the world's greatest industry. All the ships might be docked, all the factory wheels stopped, and all the railroads turned to streaks of rust, and still the race would survive, but let the plow lie idle for a year and man would perish as when the deluge swept the mountain tops.",
            "In all the great business centers of the United States there are Title Guarantee Companies, who for a consideration—to be paid by the seller—furnish an abstract of title, and insure its validity.",
            "An abstract of title is a memorandum taken from the records of the office where deeds are recorded, and showing the history of the title from the Government up to the present time.",
            "If such claims exist and are known to the buyer, he may assume them as a condition of the sale.",
            "The person selling the land and making the deed is known in law as the Grantor. The person buying the property is known as the Grantee.",
            "In the quit-claim deed the grantor conveys to the purchaser his interest in or right to the property under consideration.",
            "The special warranty deed covenants and warrants only against the acts of the grantor and those claiming title under him."
